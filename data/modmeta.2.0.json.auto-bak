your own items\nSee example code below:\n```js\nconst res = this.global.resources;\nres.add(\"cool-alloy\", \"ingot-alloy\", Color.valueOf(\"#00aaff\"), {});\n// Or JSON style\nres.add({\n\t\"cool-alloy\": {\n\t\t\"mask\": \"resources-ingot-alloy\",\n\t\t\"color\": \"#00aaff\"\n\t}\n});\n```\n\nThen add bundles as needed:\n```\nitem.coolmod-cool-alloy.name = Cool Alloy\nitem.coolmod-cool-alloy.description = B)\n```\n\n## Notes\n\nBy default, the new item's type is set to `ItemType.material`.\n\nIf you do not want this, override it with `\"def\": {\"type\": ItemType.resource}`\n\nColor should be the brightest part of the texture.\n\n\nFor JSON style item adding, the object argument must contain any number of objects in the following formats:\n```json\n\"itemname\": {\n\t\"color\": \"color\",\n\t\"mask\": \"modname-mask-texture\",\n\t\"def\": {\n\t\t\"extra\": \"fields for Item\"\n\t}\n}\n```\nOR\n```\n\"itemname\":

ingot-shiny (Copper based, default)\n* dust (Sand based)\n* clump (Coal based)\nor your own.\n\nColor may be:\n* #rrggbbaa\n* #rrggbb\n* color name, see Color.java and Pal.java\n* 32 bit int color value in decimal\n* an explicitly defined `Color` value\n\nIf you see a color of #FF00FF, (#FF00FFFF in rgba) it means that your colour failed to parse.\n\n\nadd(String, String, Color, Object) returns

which fixed all of the problem humanity previously had\n\nHumans relaxed and lived in peaceful life as with too much resources theres no space for war, with humans brushing aside the risk, mindustry was no longer being maintained properly, this resulted in the birth of cybernetic species called crux, crux managed to gain control of most human made systems and started driving humanity to extinction, luckily for the humans in the mindomeda galaxy where theres little contact are safe and their presence was forgotten,\n\nCrux ordered everything that resembles or gives memories about human existance be destroyed,\n\n fortunately it wasnt long till a group of crux droids learnt about what crux previously did, and there sharded was born, with such belief sharded spread really fast, but in the end they lost motivation as nobody know if humans did exist and if they were real, \n\nBase after base, betrayal between allies, and core by core, sharded lost, this events didn't last long as there was a control signal intercepted by one of the sharded motherships, one thing for sure it came from the \"spirits\", a government of humans who stated they are better than what they used to be, \n\nSharded quickly researched and started the production of \"shells\" for the \"spirits control\" to use, this turned the tide of war very quickly as the humans know how crux
